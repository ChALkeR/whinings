# What should a sane instant messanger look like?

_Note: this is a conjunction._

* Secure
* Peer to peer, no centralized auth
* Supports logs and syncrhonizes them
* Deleteable logs (one-side deleting, but from all devices)
* End-to-end encryption
* Three states for contacts — unvalidated (default), validated, compromised
* Suggest validating contacts (and other means of promoting security)
* Simple contact sharing
* Messages should be received by all devices at the same time, no blocking and no «priorities»
* Voice and video
* File transfer
* Sensible protection from stealing an authorized device
* Stealing an authorized device shouldn't make previous traffic decryptable
* Chat rooms (aka groups), private or public
* Audio/video multiconference, private or public

## How?

## What does an insane instant messenger look like?

_Note: this is a disjunction._

* Authentication through SMS codes as the only or default method
* Any other reason for binding accounts to mobile phone numbers
* Server-side logs in plaintext
* Priorities for devices, separate delivery — you receive messages at random devices
* No log sync
* No end-to-end encryption
* Has end-to-end encryption or other secure features, but fails to explain users how to use it
* Unsafe defaults
