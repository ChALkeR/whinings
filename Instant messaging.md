# What should a sane instant messanger look like?

* Secure
* Peer to peer, no centralized auth
* Supports logs and loads them even if they are were not on the same device
* End-to-end encryption
* Three states for contacts — unvalidated (default), validated, compromised
* Suggest validating contacts
* Simple contact sharing
* Messages should be received by all devices at the same time, no blocking and no «priorities»
* Voice and video
* File transfer
* Sensible protection from stealing an authorized device
* Deleteable logs (one-side deleting, but from all devices)
* Stealing an authorized device shouldn't make previous traffic decryptable
